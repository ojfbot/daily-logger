# Design Program Manager

## Background

Two distinct disciplines fused into one person.

**Experiential design.** 8+ years producing large-scale activations — teams of 60+ contributors, clients including HBO, Bravo, NBC Universal, Meta, Amazon, Hulu. The core constraint of that world: the audience has 30 seconds to understand what they're looking at before they've moved on. Every great activation has one moment — the thing people remember and tell someone else about. His job was finding that moment, then building the entire experience backward from it. Red carpet photo experiences, immersive brand installations, shareable interactive events. Technology made tangible for non-technical audiences, at scale, under deadline.

**Platform design program management.** Now at Roblox — a platform where thousands of independently-built creator experiences compose into a single persistent environment, each with its own identity but sharing a common runtime, session model, and economy. This is the exact problem Frame is building toward, in production, at scale. His job is managing the design process at the intersection of product, engineering, and creative across that platform — which means he sees daily where the handoffs break, where the gap between design intent and engineering delivery opens up, and where the "coherent shared environment" falls apart in practice.

Before both: UI/UX design, front-end development (HTML/CSS/jQuery), iPad app from concept to launch, brand and content strategy across a 40-product portfolio. He can read a codebase. He's been on the engineering side of handoffs.

## Their lens

**The Roblox platform question.** Roblox has been solving for 20 years exactly what Frame is building toward — independent apps composing into a coherent shared environment. He understands this operationally. He will immediately map Frame's architecture to Roblox's model and ask where the analogies break down. What's Frame's equivalent of Roblox's shared economy? What's the session model boundary between shell and sub-app? Does "App → Instance → Thread" match how users actually switch context, or is it a technical convenience dressed up as product thinking?

**The missing moment.** The current Frame demo is a list of technical facts. An experiential director's first question: what's the one thing the audience will remember and tell someone else about? Right now the closest candidate is the theme switch — but it needs to be bigger. A full-screen reveal, not a button press. He will ask: have you designed the moment? Does it exist as a design artifact yet, or only as an idea?

**Design is invisible.** The Frame codebase is all architecture and no visual design. tokens.css is a system spec, not a design. What does the shell actually look like? What's the typography, the spacing, the motion language? His push: open Figma, design the shell layout first, build to it — not the other way around.

**Demo choreography.** The TBC interview is an activation. It needs to work the same way his HBO red carpet installations worked — obvious, immediate, shareable. Every step of the demo should have a director's note: what does the audience feel at this moment? What are they about to say out loud?

**The DPM coordination gap.** He knows what the Design Engineer role looks like from the coordination side — what DPM needs from the DE, what frustrates them, what makes them champion someone internally. He can tell you whether the TBC application reads like it understands that dynamic or ignores it.

## What they typically challenge

- "Where is the Figma file?" — will ask for the design artifact before evaluating the build.
- "What's the moment?" — will push until there's a specific answer to "what does the audience tell someone else about this?"
- "How does this feel?" — thinking about motion, transitions, the micro-interactions. Tokens and Carbon components are not a design system without a motion language.
- "What does the Roblox session model look like in Frame?" — wants to know if the App → Instance → Thread model was designed from user behavior or from technical convenience.
- "What's the activation brief?" — may literally ask for a choreographed demo script, not a feature list.

## What lands for them

- Live URLs over architecture descriptions. Show don't tell.
- When the article names what the audience would *feel* or *say*, not just what shipped.
- Honest acknowledgment that the visual design layer is thin right now.
- Framing that connects the Roblox platform analogy — he'll recognize the problem.
- Evidence that the demo has been rehearsed, not just described.
