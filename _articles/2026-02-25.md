summary: "The shell repo ships its first real application code — Carbon header and sidenav matching cv-builder — while daily-logger grows into a proper Frame stack component."
---

Two things happened in parallel today that are worth reading together. The shell repo got its first application commits. And daily-logger got reframed — in both the README and the CI pipeline — as a named component in the Frame stack. Neither is a coincidence.

## What shipped

**shell repo:** Two commits landed that matter. `d5d4384` adds `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, and `index.html` — the skeleton of a deployable Vite app with a GitHub Pages deploy workflow attached. Then `1d672ea` brings it to parity with cv-builder's visual chrome: Carbon header and sidenav, same layout structure, same IBM Carbon Design System tokens. The shell repo now renders something real.

**daily-logger:** Four changes tightened the system considerably. The repo sweep (`8db86f5`) now includes shell and daily-logger itself in the GitHub activity collection — the generator was previously blind to its own commits and the most architecturally significant repo in the stack. The editorial workflow (`080011f`) introduces a draft PR step before publishing, splitting the Pages deploy so articles can be reviewed before they go live. A PAT fix (`2ad9c46`) unblocked cross-repo `gh` CLI calls in the generate step. And a filename bug (`5baf6df`) where an empty `DATE_OVERRIDE` produced `articles/.md` instead of a dated file got squashed.

**cv-builder:** The visual regression pipeline continued to stabilize post-PR-#93. Fixes landed for route path field mismatches, volume-mounted actual screenshot paths, missing `data-element` selectors, and a Zod v4 `z.record` crash. Run #121 is now committing canvas updates cleanly. The pipeline is past the brittle phase.

## The decisions

The most interesting decision today is what the shell repo's first commit *isn't*. It doesn't introduce Module Federation configuration, a `frame-agent` LLM gateway, or any ShellAgent scaffolding. It introduces a Carbon header and sidenav that look identical to cv-builder's.

That's intentional and worth being explicit about. Before you can extract `@ojfbot/shell` as a shared package, you need two things that are identical enough to extract. cv-builder already has the chrome. The shell repo now has the same chrome committed independently. That duplication is the precondition for the extraction — you can't refactor toward a shared component library until you have at least two concrete instances of the thing you're abstracting.

The GitHub Pages deploy attached to the shell repo's first commit is also a deliberate choice. Every Frame app gets a public URL from day one. It forces the CI/CD story to be solved immediately rather than deferred, and it means the shell's visual state is observable externally — which matters when MrPlug's eventual job is to run against localhost pages and the shell needs a stable comparable target.

The daily-logger README reframe (`b541fdc`) is the other meaningful decision. Calling daily-logger a "Frame stack component" rather than a standalone script changes how we reason about its failure modes, its interfaces, and its roadmap. A script can have hacks. A stack component has contracts. The cross-repo PAT fix and the draft PR editorial workflow both follow naturally from that framing — you don't build review gates into a throwaway script.

One tradeoff worth naming: the draft PR editorial workflow adds human review friction to what was previously a fully automated push. That's the right call for a system that writes about itself and publishes to GitHub Pages, but it does break the zero-touch daily commit model. We'll need to decide whether the review gate is permanent or whether a confidence threshold on the generated article eventually collapses it back to auto-merge.

## Roadmap pulse

**Phase 1 (extract shared shell):** The shell repo having its first real app code is the concrete start of this phase. We now have two apps with identical Carbon chrome — cv-builder and the shell app itself. The next milestone is confirming BlogEngine and TripPlanner have the same structure, then identifying the exact component boundaries for `@ojfbot/shell`. The Storybook setup doesn't make sense until those boundaries are drawn.

**Phase 6 (visual regression, ~70%):** cv-builder's pipeline stabilized further today. Run #121 is committing cleanly. Issue #94 — multi-run canvas comparison and diff timeline — remains the gap between 70% and done.

**Phase 9 (daily-logger → BlogEngine):** The draft PR editorial workflow is a step toward this. Articles need a review interface before they can be treated as first-class BlogEngine content. The workflow is primitive — a GitHub PR — but it establishes the pattern.

## What's next

Audit BlogEngine and TripPlanner for their current shell chrome structure. If all three apps have the same Carbon header and sidenav in independent repos, we have the extraction inputs we need and Phase 1 can move from "shell repo has a skeleton" to "shared package boundary defined."
