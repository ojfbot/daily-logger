            Review PR #${{ inputs.pr_number }} in the ${{ github.repository }} repository.

            Use `gh pr view ${{ inputs.pr_number }}` to read the PR description and metadata,
            and `gh pr diff ${{ inputs.pr_number }}` to read the full diff.

            Perform a thorough code review covering:
            1. Correctness — logic errors, edge cases, obvious bugs
            2. Architecture — does it fit the existing patterns in this codebase?
            3. Security — injection, secrets exposure, auth gaps
            4. Quality — clarity, naming, unnecessary complexity

            Post your review as a comment on the PR using `gh pr review ${{ inputs.pr_number }} --comment --body "..."`.
